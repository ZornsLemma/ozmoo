Emulator is generally b-em except for Integra-B (Windows BeebEm) or Electron (Elkulator, MAME).
Electron timings done by hand not using reported times.
Times usually "best of 3"
b-em 500% speed doesn't seem to affect the timings significantly even on floppy disc heavy runs so using that freely.
Quoting times to two decimal places but in practice variation means it's probably best to round to one decimal place, if that

=== Ozmoo 4.4 2021-02-18 ===

Electron always used what we now call medium dynamic memory model on this version
Other non-tube binaries use big dynamic memory model

BBC B, 16K SWR, DFS 1.20, mode 7 $15a/$99c4 $159/$99c2 $15a/$99c0 -> 780.28 seconds
- lots of disc access

BBC B+, no SWR, DFS, mode 7 can't run the game

M128, DFS, mode 7 $340/$4cac $340/$4cac $340/$4ca9 -> 375.86 seconds

Electron (Elkulator), 16K SWR, E00 DFS, drive noises on, mode 6 [$f8/$c022] 37:30 -> 2250 seconds
- lots of disc access
- stopwatch timing means there's a good few seconds of variation possible here; I tried to start and stop when the automated timings appeared but it wasn't that precise

=== Ozmoo 5.8 alpha 12 ===

BBC shadow binary uses big dynamic memory model
Other non-tube binaries use medium dynamic memory model

BBC B, 16K SWR, DFS 1.20, mode 7 crashes! -> probably won't do any more testing with this version

=== Ozmoo 6.0 alpha 15 ===

BBC shadow binary uses big dynamic memory model
Other non-tube binaries use medium dynamic memory model

BBC B, 16K SWR, DFS 1.20, mode 7 crashes! -> probably won't do any more testing with this version

=== Ozmoo 7.3 alpha 25 ===

BBC shadow binary uses big dynamic memory model
Other non-tube binaries use medium dynamic memory model

BBC B, 16K SWR, DFS 1.20, mode 7 $29e/$126e6 $29e/$126ea $2a0/$126f0 -> 748.24 seconds
- lots of disc access

BBC B+, no SWR, DFS, mode 7 $3ee/$b356 $3f0/$b354 $3ee/$b34e -> 448.96 seconds
- lots of disc access

M128, DFS, mode 7 $7c9/$9479 $7ca/$9480 $7ca/$9480 -> 360.16 seconds

Electron (Elkulator), 16K SWR, E00 DFS, drive noises on, mode 6 [$1df/$17614] 38:17 -> 2297 seconds
- lots of disc access
- disappointingly slower than 4.4, but I can't remember at what point I found a slowdown on Electron and tweaked it
- this is only 2% slower and although the discrepancy is *not* caused by stopwatch inaccuracy, it isn't impossible miscellaneous changes in load on the Windows PC running Elkulator had some influence

=== Ozmoo 9.16 alpha 37 ===

BBC shadow binary uses big dynamic memory model TODO: This was probably done with DEBUG_BIG_DYNMEM=1, which will harm performance (maybe not much, but a bit)did feel a bit of stretch in back, can't do hp as in Skegness
Other non-tube binaries use medium dynamic memory model

BBC B, 16K SWR, DFS 1.20, mode 7 $2a9/$11139 $2a9/$11139 $2a9/$1113f -> 692.64 seconds
- lots of disc access
- impressively faster compared to 7.3 (which is in turn impressively faster than 4.4) - I *suspect* the switch to medium dynamic memory model in 7.3 is responsible for a big part of this improvement, but I don't really know, and I am genuinely a bit surprised 9.16 is that much faster, unless (pure guesswork) the low memory rework means it has a bit of extra memory to play with and that makes all the difference.

BBC B+, no SWR, DFS, mode 7 $3ef/$b361 $3ef/$b35f $3f0/$b35e -> 449.10 seconds
- lots of disc access
- fractionally slower than 7.3 alpha 25 but not worth worrying about

M128, DFS, mode 7 $7c1/$93fd $7c1/$93fd $7c1/$93fd -> 359.00 seconds
- fractionally faster than 7.3 alpha 25 but probably not significant, in any case this is fine

Electron (Elkulator), 16K SWR, E00 DFS, drive noises on, mode 6 [$1df/$16aa7] 36:09 -> 2169 seconds
- lots of disc access
- pleasingly faster than even 4.4; it's only 3.6% faster than 4.4 but that's not bad
- it is possible these times are actually quite variable as so far I've only done one run with each version due to the time taken (I don't see a "run >100%" option in Elkulator) - probably OK but worth checking
- anyway, it looks like there's no performance regression (quite the opposite), which is the main thing
